# Hey there! 👋 I'm Choong Yi Yang

I'm a **22-year-old** Malaysian currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Computer Science (Software Engineering)** at **Universiti Malaya**. As a **final year student**, I’m fully immersed in the world of software development, constantly learning and exploring new technologies. Right now, I’m knee-deep in my **Final Year Project**, developing an **On-Campus Cafeteria System**—a mobile app designed to transform campus dining by streamlining the cafeteria experience. 🍽️📱

## 💻 A Bit About My Coding Journey
My programming adventure has taken me through several languages and frameworks. I’ve explored:

- **Programming Languages**:  
  I've "played around" with **Java, Python, JavaScript**, along with **HTML, CSS**, and databases like **SQL and NoSQL**.
  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**:  
  I’ve worked with popular frameworks and platforms, such as **React, React Native, Firebase**, and **Bootstrap**, using them to build dynamic applications that aim to solve real-world problems.
  
- **IDEs & Tools**:  
  My go-to coding environments include **VS Code, Visual Studio, IntelliJ, Android Studio**, and **Unity** for various projects, from mobile apps to web development and even game development!

## 🎯 Current Focus
At this stage of my journey, I’m working on my **On-Campus Cafeteria System**, a project that I believe will provide a practical solution for students and staff to navigate their daily dining routines more efficiently. It's my largest and most exciting project to date, combining everything I've learned about mobile app development and backend integration.

Beyond that, I'm constantly refining my skills in software engineering, finding better ways to write cleaner, more efficient code while learning about design patterns, state management, and database optimizations. Though I’m still discovering my **true passion** in the vast field of tech, I’m always open to new opportunities to expand my knowledge and make meaningful contributions. 🛠️

## 🌟 My Hobbies
When I’m not coding or working on assignments, I love indulging in my favorite hobbies:

- **Swimming** 🏊: My go-to way to stay active and clear my mind.
- **Video Games** 🎮: A fun escape that also keeps my problem-solving skills sharp!
- **Anime** 📺 & **K-pop** 🎵: I’m a big fan of the world of Japanese anime and Korean pop music—these are my fuel for inspiration when I need a creative break.

## 🌱 Future Aspirations
I see myself continuing to grow as a software engineer, aiming to develop products that impact people in a positive way. Although I’m still on the lookout for that "one true passion" in the coding universe, I’ve always been driven by the desire to **learn, adapt, and solve problems**. Whether it’s building mobile apps, websites, or backend systems, I’m excited to continue honing my skills and finding innovative solutions to tech challenges.
